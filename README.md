# Question 1
Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person` (String).
When called the method should print to the terminal:
"Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?" -->
def offer_rose string
    puts  "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose('person')
# Question 2
Assume the following hash...
```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: ["Robby Benson"],
    guests: []
  }
}
```
Using Ruby...
- Remove "Belle" from `residents`
- Add "Belle" to the `guests` array
Type your solution directly below this line:


town[:residents].delete('Belle')
town[:guests] = ['Belle']



# Question 3
Assume you have an array of strings representing friends' names...
```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```
Using a loop and string interpolation, print each string in `friends` to the Terminal...
```ruby
"Belle is friends with Chip Potts"
"Belle is friends with Cogsworth"
"Belle is friends with Lumière"
"Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts"
```
friends.each do |friend|
   p  "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end



# Question 4
Assume the following array of hashes:
```ruby
lost_boys = [
  {name: 'Tootles', age: 11},
  {name: 'Nibs', age: 9},
  {name: 'Slightly', age: 10},
  {name: 'Curly', age: 8},
  {name: 'The Twins', age: 9}
]
```
Use `.each` to iterate over the `lost_boys` array and increase each boy's age by 30 years.

lost_boys.each { |name|
     name[:age] += 10
}


# Question 5
Assume the following array:
```ruby
children = ['Wendy', 'John', 'Michael']
```
Use `.map` to iterate through the `children` array and add ` Darling` to the end
of their names. Assign the returned array to a variable called `darling_children`.
Example: `Wendy` should become `Wendy Darling` in the new array.


# Question 6
Define a Ruby class called `Animal`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` (String) attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`


# Question 7
Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba" an assign it to a variable named `pumba`.


# Question 8

Write a method called `toonify` that takes two parameters, `accent` and `sentence`.
- If `accent` is the string `"daffy"`, return a modified version of `sentence` with all "s" replaced with "th".
- If the accent is `"elmer"`, replace all "r" with "w".
- Feel free to add your own accents as well!
- If the accent is not recognized, just return the sentence as-is.

```ruby
toonify "daffy", "so you smell like sausage"
#=> "tho you thmell like thauthage"
```
Call the method twice with different arguments
