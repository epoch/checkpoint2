# Question 1
# Define a method called offer_rose, which should take one argument named person (String). When called the method should print to the terminal: "Would you take this rose, person, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

def offer_rose(name)
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{name}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end
offer_rose("Robert")



# Question 2
# Assume the following hash...

# town = {
#   residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
#   castle: {
#     num_rooms: 47,
#     residents: ["Robby Benson"],
#     guests: []
#   }
# }
# Using Ruby...

# Remove "Belle" from residents
# Add "Belle" to the guests array Type your solution directly below this line:
# Question 3
# Assume you have an array of strings representing friends' names...

# friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
# Using a loop and string interpolation, print each string in friends to the Terminal...

# "Belle is friends with Chip Potts"
# "Belle is friends with Cogsworth"
# "Belle is friends with Lumière"
# "Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts"
# Question 4
# Assume the following array of hashes:

# lost_boys = [
#   {name: 'Tootles', age: 11},
#   {name: 'Nibs', age: 9},
#   {name: 'Slightly', age: 10},
#   {name: 'Curly', age: 8},
#   {name: 'The Twins', age: 9}
# ]
# Use .each to iterate over the lost_boys array and increase each boy's age by 30 years.

# Question 5
# Assume the following array:

# children = ['Wendy', 'John', 'Michael']
# Use .map to iterate through the children array and add Darling to the end of their names. Assign the returned array to a variable called darling_children. Example: Wendy should become Wendy Darling in the new array.

# Question 6
# Define a Ruby class called Animal. Each Animal should have...

# A name (String) attribute
# A greet instance method
# The ability to "get" and "set" name
# Question 7
# Create a new Animal instance with the name "Pumba" an assign it to a variable named pumba.

# Question 8
# Write a method called toonify that takes two parameters, accent and sentence.

# If accent is the string "daffy", return a modified version of sentence with all "s" replaced with "th".
# If the accent is "elmer", replace all "r" with "w".
# Feel free to add your own accents as well!
# If the accent is not recognized, just return the sentence as-is.
# toonify "daffy", "so you smell like sausage"
# #=> "tho you thmell like thauthage"
